Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes.

Joda-Time is the de facto standard date and time library for Java prior to Java SE 8. Users are now asked to migrate tojava.time (JSR-310).

A selection of key features:

- LocalDate - date without time
- LocalTime - time without date
- Instant - an instantaneous point on the time-line
- DateTime - full date and time with time-zone
- DateTimeZone - a better time-zone
- Duration and Period - amounts of time
- Interval - the time between two instants
- A comprehensive and flexible formatter-parser
